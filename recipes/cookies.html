    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The flavor of a peanut butter cookie is just hard to beat. They’re perfectly sweet and buttery rich, and they’re
        sure to satisfy that peanut butter craving. And who doesn’t love that traditional fork pressed criss cross
        pattern? I love how it sets these PB cookies apart from others.</p>
    <p>Plus, it makes these a fun cookie for the kids to help make, my kids love doing the rolling and pressing.</p>
    <p>This is my go-to recipe for peanut butter cookies and I hope it becomes yours too! They’re one of those cookies
        that’s just to hard to resist when someone has baked a fresh batch.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Butter and peanut butter</li>
        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Baking soda</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening, butter, brown sugar and white sugar. Beat in the eggs,
            peanut butter and vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt and ground ginger, stir into the creamed
            mixture. Finally, stir in the rolled oats and candied ginger. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto an
            unprepared cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on
            wire racks. Store in an airtight container when cool.</li>
