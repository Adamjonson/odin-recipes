    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The flavor of a peanut butter cookie is just hard to beat. They’re perfectly sweet and buttery rich, and they’re sure to satisfy that peanut butter craving. And who doesn’t love that traditional fork pressed criss cross pattern? I love how it sets these PB cookies apart from others.</p>
<p>Plus, it makes these a fun cookie for the kids to help make, my kids love doing the rolling and pressing.</p>
<p>This is my go-to recipe for peanut butter cookies and I hope it becomes yours too! They’re one of those cookies that’s just to hard to resist when someone has baked a fresh batch.</p>
